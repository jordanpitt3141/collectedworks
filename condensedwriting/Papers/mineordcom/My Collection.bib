abstract = {A numerical model for the solution of the two-dimensional dam break problem is described. The model which is based on a second-order approximate Riemann solver with a van Leer type limiter is used to solve the shallow water wave equation on a Cartesian grid. The shallow water equations include source terms which account for resistance to the flow and the influence of the bed slope. The wetting and drying process is also considered. The model is verified by comparing the model output with documented results. Very good agreement has been achieved in the verification phase. A simple example of the collapse of a water supply reservoir in a narrow valley is used to demonstrate the capability of the model. The model is shown to be stable and robust. It is capable of resolving shocks, handling complex geometry, including the influence of steep bed slopes and simulating the wetting and drying process. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.
