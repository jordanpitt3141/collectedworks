\section{Cell Averaged G}
Fit a parabola so that the averages over the neighbouring cells is correct. First the parabola is centred at the midpoint so that:
\[P_i(x) = a(x-x_i)^2 + b(x-x_i) +c \]

We have a list of cell averages and we want this parabola to match the cell averages over the cell it is centered on and the two neihbouring cells. This gives 3 equations we can solve for for a,b and c.
